Team standup meeting - January 22, 2026

John: Good morning everyone. Let's start with updates.

Sarah: I completed the user authentication module. It's ready for review.

Mike: Great! I'll review it by end of day. I'm currently working on the database migration.

John: Sounds good. Sarah, can you help Mike with the migration if he needs it?

Sarah: Absolutely, happy to help.

John: One more thing - we need to decide on the deployment strategy. Should we go with blue-green or canary?

Mike: I think canary would be safer for our use case.

Sarah: Agreed. Let's go with canary deployment.

John: Perfect. Mike, can you document the deployment plan by Friday?

Mike: Will do.

John: Any blockers or questions?

Sarah: Do we have access to the production environment yet?

John: Not yet, I'll follow up with DevOps today.

Mike: Also, should we schedule a code review session for next week?

John: Good idea. Let's do Tuesday at 2 PM.

Sarah: Works for me.

Mike: Same here.

John: Great, meeting adjourned. Thanks everyone!
